945 - 10:00 figure out what the hell to do
Write it it right here
10:00 - 10:30 Get the outcoef to work and the exponent of the u to work. 

What the program needs to do:

-Use a loop from j = 0 to j = newexponent + 1 (because sin^4 goes to 
((1+cos^2(x))^2) and that creates 3 terms when foiled (1 more than the 
new exponent) 
-Use NcR to find the new outer coefficient for each new term
-The new exponent of the term is 'R' * 2 (Because it is traditionally u^2)

Need to ask maya how to make an array that will expand in C++ and will be able to change it

Ask why The constructor for TrigArray wasn't working.
